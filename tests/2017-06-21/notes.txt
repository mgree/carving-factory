clean up initial insertion points
identify clusters, smooth out (same as initial point compensation?)

min cut depth to avoid wasting time

overdraw mode is too aggressive
  switch to alpha mode for more realistic/less ugly output?
  can we do better than drawing a million lines?

use depth map globally to calculate z

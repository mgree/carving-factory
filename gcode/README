GCodeReader.java
Created by Sonia Grunwald for the CNC Carving Factory with the Greenberg Lab.

This code will take in a gcode file and produce a GUI drawing the
design the gcode will produce. It also prints a feed of instructions
executed. One can chose the dimensions of the piece of wood they plan to
work on in inches and the GUI window will appear at these dimensions and
show the line width proportionally.


Command Line Arguments:

java GCodeReader gCodeTestFile.txt dimX dimY sScaleNum

The "gCodeTestFile.txt" must be a file of valid gcode. At the current moment
our parser can handle almost all gcode commands, but certain things such as
inline parameter settings (with #), return characters in the middle of the
line, and cancellation of commands (ie, G91.1 to cancel a G91 command) have
yet to be accounted for. Keep this in mind when entering a gcode file.

Optional arguments:
dimX
  This will be the X dimension of the GUI window (in inches)
dimY
  This will be the Y dimension of the GUI window (in inches)
sScaleNum
  This will be the factor by which the gcode drawing is scaled up. Note that
  this number must be preceded by an 's' (s10 is a valid scale but 10 is not).
  This is used for debugging your gcode (finding out what your values need to be)


A note on argument ordering:
  All arguments are optional, but if one dimension is set, the other must be set
  as well. The dimensions default to a 2' X 4'  piece of wood and the scale
  defaults to 1. Either or both of the pair of dimensions or scale number, may be entered.
  If the pair of dimensions is entered, these arguments MUST go first.

Valid Examples:
  java GCodeReader gCodeTestFile.txt 36 24
      //opens drawing in a 3 ft by 2 ft proportional window as large as will
      //fit on your screen
  java GCodeReader gCodeTestFile.txt s2
      //Opens in the default 2 ft by 4 ft window with the drawing scaled up by 2


Invalid Examples:
  java GCodeReader gCodeTestFile.txt s3 36 48
      //dimensions must go first
  java GCodeReader gCodeTestFile.txt s2 s3
      //only one scale may be entered

GCodeReader.java
Created by Sonia Grunwald for the CNC Carving Factory with the Greenberg Lab.

This code will take in a gcode file and produce a GUI drawing the
design the gcode will produce. It also prints a feed of instructions
executed.


Command Line Arguments:

java GCodeReader gCodeTestFile.txt dimX dimY sScaleNum strokeWidth

The "gCodeTestFile.txt" must be a file of valid gcode. At the current moment
our parser can handle almost all gcode commands, but certain things such as
inline parameter settings (with #), return characters in the middle of the
line, and cancellation of commands (ie, G91.1 to cancel a G91 command) have
yet to be accounted for. Keep this in mind when entering a gcode file.

Optional arguments:
dimX
  This will be the X dimension of the GUI window (in pixels)
dimY
  This will be the Y dimension of the GUI window (in pixels)
sScaleNum
  This will be the factor by which the gcode drawing is scaled up. Note that
  this number must be preceded by an 's' (s10 is a valid scale but 10 is not)
strokeWidth
  This will be the strokeWidth of the line drawn in the GUI

A note on argument ordering:
  All arguments are optional, but if one dimension is set, the other must be set
  as well. Any combination of the pair of dimensions, scale number, and the
  stroke width may be entered. If the pair of dimensions is entered, these
  arguments MUST go first. Other than that, ordering does not matter and the
  scale number and stroke width are interchangeable.

Valid Examples:
  java GCodeReader gCodeTestFile.txt 100 100.0 s3 5
      //opens in a 100x100 window scaled by 3 with a 5pt line width
  java GCodeReader gCodeTestFile.txt 100 100.0 5 s3
      //same as above
  java GCodeReader gCodeTestFile.txt 10 s2
      //Opens in the default 300x300 window with a 10pt line scaled by 2
  java GCodeReader gCodeTestFile.txt 10
      //Opens in the default 300x300 window with a 10pt line

  java GCodeReader gCodeTestFile.txt s2
      //Opens in the default 300x300 window with a 1pt line scaled by 2


Invalid Examples:
  java GCodeReader gCodeTestFile.txt s3 5 100 100.0
      //dimensions must go first
  java GCodeReader gCodeTestFile.txt s2 s3
      //only one scale may be entered

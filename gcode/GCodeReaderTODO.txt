Greenberg GCodeReader Tasks:

//command class
//G or M
//number for mode
//other access parameters
//hashmap (each parameter to another)
//only lets you set specific parameters

//parse routine
//series of parse line calls
//some list of commands (parsed each line)
//separate routine which simulates or draws program
//command line to give parameters (dimensions and drill bit size and maximum error -- derive scaling factor)
//output min max of each coordinate

//parse in whole thing
//analysis
  //dimensions, window size, is it ok
  //maximum (exceed depth, bounds)
  //eventually machine limitations
//simulate



//one day
//command knows what to do given surface and current info
//command class/interface
//separate classes for different commands


Thoughts for later:
can modes in command class be lowercase vs uppercase
just use tochararray once and then pass that instead of passing strings in GCodeReader??




My GCodeReader Tasks:

    //TODO:
      //handle various spaces
      //handle (or ignore) other letters
          //create method that scans for the next letter or next number
          //Use these to find next relevant section of the string (instead of
          //    index of x/y/z)
          //find next letter, switch on that letter (if one var isn't given, retain from last line)
              // g00 / g01 draw line
              // g02 clockwise arc
              // g03 counterclockwise arc
              // g04 dwell
              // g12 clockwise circle
              // g13 counterclockwise circle
              // g51 scale axes
              // g81 hole drilling
              // g94 feed per minute
              // F is feed rate
              // N line number (skip)
          //start is first letter of string, process rest (in some cases recursive, others not)

      //Do different colors for z (pick a range and process Z as a percentage of that range)
          //search for all z's, get max and min, translate this to a 0-1 scale, set
          //Z as that number * 255
      //Output information for other letters
      //Draw curves
      //Create file that is a play-by-play of what was executed (with the unprocessed lines)
